        For convenience, the exercise requirements are reproduced below.</p>
    <h2>Active Learning: Launch countdown</h2>
    <p>In this exercise, we want you to print out a simple launch countdown to the output box, from 10 down to Blastoff.
        Specifically, we want you to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Loop from 10 down to 0. We've provided you with an initializer &mdash; <code>let i = 10;</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
            For each iteration, create a new paragraph and append it to the output <code>&lt;/div&gt;</code>, which
                we've selected using <code>const output = document.querySelector('.output');</code>. In comments, we've
                provided you with three code lines that need to be used somewhere inside the loop:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <code>const para = document.createElement('p');</code> &mdash; creates a new paragraph.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>output.appendChild(para);</code> &mdash; appends the paragraph to the output
                    <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>para.textContent =</code> &mdash; makes the text inside the paragraph equal to whatever you
                    put on the right-hand side, after the equals sign.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Different iteration numbers require different text to be put in the paragraph for that iteration (you'll need a conditoinal statement and multiple <code>para.textContent =</code> lines):
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If the number is 10, print "Countdown 10" to the paragraph.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the number is 0, print "Blast off!" to the paragraph.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For any other number, print just the number to the paragraph.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Remember to include an iterator! However, in this example we are counting down after each iteration, not up, so you <strong>don't</strong> want <code>i++</code> &mdash; how do you iterate downwards?</li>
    </ul>
