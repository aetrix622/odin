# The Odin Project
==================

## Completed Coursework by Joe Rochinski

This repository contains the various exercises and projects created as I worked my way through The Odin Project full-stack webdev course. 

Many of these files (particularly the ones found in the foundations folder) begain their lives as separate repositories. These were ultimately merged into this singular master repo to declutter my github account.

The exercises are sorted in a folder structure that loosely follows the lesson path scheme at theodinproject.com/paths.
